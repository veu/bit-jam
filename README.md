# Descend to Madness

Made for [1 bit jam](https://itch.io/jam/bit-jam).

You’re stuck in a dungeon far below the surface.
Try to find a way out but do not look at the inhabitants of this dreadful place;
the mere sight will make you go mad.
The only way to make them disappear is acknowledging their presence by walking a circle around them.

**Warning:** This game includes rapid flashing lights which may cause seizures.

## Controls

### Viewing

Use arrow keys or swipe to look in any of the four cardinal directions.

### Moving

Press space or hold down your finger to move one step in the direction you’re looking.

## Visual Cues

You can barely see down here so here are a few hints. Make sure to draw a map when moving around so you don’t get lost.

### Light

You’re standing right in front of a wall.

### Dark

You’re looking at a hallway. The next wall may be one step ahead or one hundred.

### Flicker

A monster is right in front of your eyes and you’ve gone mad. Press space to restart from the last checkpoint.

### Slow Alternation

You’re standing in front of an open door.
Stepping through it will put you behind the door into the next level and set a checkpoint.
Note that doors look like walls until all monsters in the current room are gone.
